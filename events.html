                                        Clean water scarcity has become one of the big problems in India and other countries all over the world affecting people’s lives in many ways. This big problem cannot be solved alone or only a group of some people, it is the problem which needs global efforts of people together.
	With judicious use of animation and visual effects, the most mundane system utility can become a rich visual experience. And we at Animazione are here to just do that, to gauge how compelling a competetive advantage you possess in this art form of dynamic images synthesised out of your thoughts. Give us an insight into your ‘visual vocabulary’ and we give you the right place to showcase it here at AXIS 15.So get ready and breathe life into characters and ideas that might never have existed but for your imagination into the world that you have invented.

											<b>Q. What is the difference in animation 2D and 3D?</b>
											<p>The most obvious difference between the two genres of animation is the three dimensional characteristics or the appearance of depth. 2D animation is created by drawing almost every frame of the animated movie and is the base of 3D animation. 3D animation is created by changing the poses and the placement of already created 3D models. It has more depth and is more realistic, it is a series of images/ objects created using computers or any other digital media.</p>

                                        A rise in demand of coal, oil and other minerals was envisaged by the government of a thriving state. 
                                        They, after days of discussion opted for the use of railroads to transport the minerals and oils. It 
                                        was favoured as it would allow to transport greater amount of goods in a less time. Moreover, it avoided
                                        roadway congestion. A government contractor was assigned the project to lay down railway tracks to facilitate
                                        the transport of minerals and oils to the state. But the railway lines could not be connected as they 
                                        encountered a river. Engineers decided to connect the railway lines through a truss bridge over the river 
                                        which would have the strength to bear a heavy freight locomotive.

                                    <p>
                                        Now, imagine yourself in their position and construct a truss bridge using popsicle sticks. Use your inventiveness
                                        to make a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing bridge.

Selected participants from each round will proceed to the next round. The second round will be where the participants will be separated into teams and a game will be played amongst these teams that will test their resource management skills. The third round will consist of a group discussion and further interviews with out panel of judges.

                                        221B Baker Street is an online quiz event, held on the AXIS ’15 website. It consists of two sub-events, General Mode and Story Mode. Instructions specific to each mode will be displayed on the event page prior to commencement of the Mode. Both Modes consist of questions in the form of a series of images presented to the participant. The participant has to deduce the answer from said image, taking the help of any and all resources at her/his disposal. The winner will be judged as the person with the most questions solved in the shortest time. Instructions for receipt of prize money if participant is able to come to prize ceremony, unable and lives in India, or unable and lives abroad

                                        Remember Shah Rukh Khan’s movie SWADES which received an overwhelmingly strong critical acclaim around the
                                        globe where he sets up a small hydro-electric power plant that would solve the problem of irregular electricity
                                        and make the village self-sufficient. That’s what define the event TURBO FLUX.

                                        The basic applications of fluid mechanics is to be applied where the water is to be progressed from one point to 
                                        another passing through various obstacles so that it falls over the turbine with sufficient velocity, rotates it 
                                        and thus producing significant electricity. Knowledge of high school fluid mechanics and mere capability of 
                                        application of them are just its prerequisite.

                                        Participants have to take the water to a certain height using suction pumps (arena is shown in the fig.) overcoming 
                                        obstacles in the path and various hurdles, as in water reaches the highest level with minimum losses. To measure the
                                        energy possessed with the water, it is gushed on to the turbine which is coupled to dynamo and the voltage generated
                                        is measured.

                                        A terrible conflict is brewing in the Republic of Yemen, with two groups clashing in the battle for control of the country. Caught in the crossfire are millions of innocent Yemeni civilians and foreign nationals, which include over 5000 Indian citizens. 
Operation Raahat has been launched by the Indian Armed Forces to keep India’s children safe. With military intelligence reporting the presence of ground-to-air missiles in the possession of terrorist groups, Army Command had deemed it unsafe to send in air transport. As the captain of the INS Sumitra, you have been placed under the direct command of Gen. V. K. Singh, and have been tasked with safely evacuating refugees from the Yemeni port of Aden to Djibouti across the Red Sea, where they will be picked up by the Indian Air Force. 
This will be no easy feat. The hostile situation in the country ensures any rescue must be carried out swiftly and stealthily. To this end, your scouts have selected a small, discreet location to carry out the evacuation. Getting to this location will prove challenging, however, as it is located far inland, with narrow paths and choppy waters to hinder your movement. 
Will you be able to reunite them with their families?

Do you think you possess the ability to hit the bull’s eye of invisible targets? Can you find answers where others can’t see any?
We bring to you an event that will push you to your limits and make you explore the genius residing inside. DEXTER is not just an aptitude test. It is a journey that puts your intellectual as well as interactive skills to test. Taking forward the huge success from last year, we present to you an opportunity to identify your skills. We will encourage and help you to enhance your endowments.
Through DEXTER, we aim to not just find an intelligent kid, but to find and help groom a complete individual equipped with all the tools required to excel in this competitive world. Students will learn to open up their minds, think out of the box, and gain a whole new interactive experience. Also, a healthy competitive spirit will be inculcated among the participants.
AXIS aims to slightly nudge the dexterity that resides in these minds and to provide a platform for them to showcase their competence, thus taking a step towards innovation and excellence.

Purely merit based. After analyzing all the papers, cutoff will be decided “RELATIVELY” based on the overall performance. There is no “ABSOLUTE” cutoff pre-decided. Keeping in mind the fact that a 12th grade child may have an edge over an 8th class child, cutoff for lower classes can be assumed to be lower than the higher classes, so as not give any advantage of age/experience to higher class students.

Round 2 remains a surprise for the children with many skills to be judged on, thus, every individual is carefully scrutinized according to the skill which the round tests. A marking system is devised and based on the individual performance; he/she is allotted marks accordingly. Toppers are then decided on their total score of Round 2 (Round 1 marks don’t play any role here).
